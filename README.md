# theFramework
The Ultimate CSS Framework made just like Discourse! Integrate Discourse styling in your pages for FREE! This framework won't contain any Discourse logo or name. If you include that, be ready to face the consequences!

Taken permission from Discourse too! https://meta.discourse.org/t/am-i-allowed-to-use-discourse-like-styling-in-my-website/243060/2
